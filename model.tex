\subsection{Definitions}
As we use the terms divisiveness, polarization, and privacy throughout the paper, we take care to define them here.

\begin{itemize}
\item  \emph{Divisiveness} of a law refers to the extent to which the different citizens value the law differently -- measured, for example, by the standard deviation in valuations.

\item \emph{Polarization} of a society refers to the grouping of individuals into sets that have little influence over each other, or that prioritize the welfare of insiders over that of outsiders.

\item \emph{Privacy} refers to an individual's ability to possess property (physical or intellectual) that is free from inspection or search. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
Our general model presents an incentive structure that relates the polarization of a society to the passage of divisive laws. At a high level, our model captures the following dynamics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each individual begins with an initial evaluation of the law. This represents the direct benefit of the law to that individual.
\item Each individual may (optionally) be influenced by others.  The polarization of society is captured in an influence matrix.
\item An individual's support for a law is found by combining their initial evaluations with those of their influencers.
\item Laws that gather positive support from a majority of citizens are passed or maintained.
%\item Each individual may have a non-commutative influence on another individual's evaluation.
%%\item We distinguish an individual's derived benefit of a law from an individual's support of a law. 
%\item An individual's support is a function of their derived benefit together with a weighted influence of others. %influence With respect to a fixed law, suppose the mixing process happens and we measure, then we cannot tell the difference between the influence and the case where each individual makes their own evaluation or is influenced by others.  
\end{itemize}

%Want to talk about privacy.
\subsection {Citizen Influence}
For each pair of citizens $i,j\in\{1,\dots N\},$ define $$a_{ij}\in [0,1]$$ to be the influence of person $j$ on person $i$.  We may think of $a_{ij}$ also as the affinity person $i$ has toward person $j$. 

% into account when making decisions, or the extent to which person $j$ influences the decision of person $i$. 

Each individual will arrive at a level of support for the law based on a weighted average of the valuations of their influencers, where the weighting is determined by the influence parameters $a_{ij}$. To be consistent with the notion of weighted average, we thus require $$\sum_ja_{ij}=1.$$%something similarly concrete-ish.

\subsection{Citizen Valuations of Laws}
Given a law $L$ and a citizen $j\in\{1,\dots N\}$, %define $$L(j)\in[0,1]$$ to be the probability that the law targets $j$.
%Alternatively, 
let $$V_L(i)\in\mathbb{R}$$ represent the direct impact of the law on person $i$. We assume that the direct impact of $L$ is unbounded because laws may save a life or take away life from individuals impacted by them.

If an individual's direct valuation for a law is perfectly in tune with the direct impact on the law then this person's support for a law will be $V_L(i)$. % weight his or her own opinion so much above others that for all practical purposes we have $a_{ii}\approx 1$, $a_{ij}\approx 0$ for $j\neq i$, and the support of $i$ for $L$ is exactly $$a_{ii}L(i)=L(i).$$
In other cases, for example where a law has little or no direct impact on the individual, a ban on muslims for example, initial evaluation of the law may be something very close to zero, i.e. neither positive nor negative.  Nevertheless a person's view of the law may evolve based on the views and experiences of their influences.  In such cases, we may suppose that after some amount of time, an individual's support for L evolves to become 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:support}
U_L(i)=\sum_ja_{ij}V_L(j).
\end{equation}


%If we order the elements of this vector and graph it on a line, we can see directly from the graph a number of things
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item what percentage supports the law -- aka where the graph crosses the horizontal axis
%\item the existence of distinct homogeneous clusters -- regions along the horizontal axis where the function takes on a homogeneous value
%\item the extent to which the law is divisive for the society -- aka the magnitude of disutility for non-supporters of the law.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%How does privacy enter this picture?
%Privacy decreases the law's overall enforceability, and in particular, it makes it harder to enforce the law selectively.
%
%The crux of the analysis will be to show that privacy is especially welfare-enhancing in cases where a society is more polarized.
